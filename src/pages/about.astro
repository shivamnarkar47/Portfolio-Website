      Being born at <span class="italic">Mumbai, India</span>. I have been
      raised in quite creative environment. I just wasted (in terms of career)
      my 15 years at school learning nothing but some sort of <span
        class="italic">a + b = ab.</span
      > I completed my high school at <span class="italic">Summer 2020</span>.
      During the span of COVID-19 Lockdowns, I learnt about the web development.
      Started using HTML, CSS and JS at first. Built small projects for
      practice. <br />

      But after hard-work of 2 years, finally I have become a FrontEnd Developer
      with skills of creating websites using React JS, Vue JS, Tailwind CSS, Node
      JS and MongoDB. Now, I am pursuing my Diploma at <span class="italic">Vidyalankar Polytechnic, Mumbai</span><br />
      <br />
      Also while attending college, I achieve a milestone by getting a special mention
      of my team at an inter-college hackathon. We had created a Waste Management
      App which provides unwasted food from traditional events to NGOs.
